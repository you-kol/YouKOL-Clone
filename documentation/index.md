## Getting Started

To get started with the YouKOL Clone application:

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start PocketBase:
   ```bash
   cd pocketbase_windows
   ./pocketbase.exe serve
   ```
5. Initialize PocketBase:
   ```bash
   npm run init-pb
   ```
6. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

## Implementation Status

### Completed Steps
- ✅ Step 1: Setup PocketBase and Dependencies
- ✅ Step 2: Create PocketBase Collections
- ✅ Step 3: Implement PocketBase Service
- ✅ Step 4: Add Session Management
- ✅ Step 5: Add Frontend Authentication Integration
- ✅ Step 6: Profile Management Implementation
- ✅ Step 7: Frontend Integration
- ✅ Step 8: Enhancement Preferences Feature
- ✅ Step 9: Security Enhancements

Step 3 implementation includes:
- Robust user authentication (registration, login, password reset)
- Comprehensive profile management with proper JSON handling
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Automatic profile creation for users without profiles
- Optimized health checks with proper error reporting

Step 4 implementation includes:
- Server-side session storage using Express session
- Secure HTTP-only cookies with environment-specific settings
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- Comprehensive test suite for the authentication flow
- Logout functionality with proper session cleanup

Step 9 security enhancements include:
- CSRF protection for all sensitive API endpoints (auth, profile, image enhancement)
- Proper CSRF token generation and validation
- Client-side CSRF token management for API requests
- Enhanced HTTP security headers with HSTS, CSP, and clickjacking protection
- User data caching for improved authentication performance
- Comprehensive request logging for monitoring and debugging
- Automated security audit tool for vulnerability detection
- Rate limiting with differentiated thresholds for sensitive endpoints
- Brute force protection with IP-based tracking

### In Progress
- Additional HTTP security headers optimization
- Rate limiting fine-tuning
- Security audit preparation

### Current Development Focus
Authentication and security implementation is now complete. The focus can now shift to feature enhancements and user experience improvements.

## Key Features

1. **Image Enhancement**: Automatic and manual enhancement of images using AI technology
2. **Media Capture & Upload**: Capture from camera or upload from device
3. **Enhancement Presets**: Save and manage enhancement settings
4. **Before/After Comparison**: Compare original and enhanced images
5. **Batch Processing**: Enhance multiple images at once
6. **User Management**: Secure authentication and user profile handling
7. **Security Features**: CSRF protection, secure cookies, and authentication middleware

## Implementation Approach

YouKOL Clone uses a server-side approach for authentication and data management:

```
Client (Browser) <---> Node.js Server <---> PocketBase
```

This architecture enhances security by:
- Keeping authentication tokens and sensitive operations server-side
- Using session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Preventing direct client access to the database
- Centralizing business logic on the server
