## Introduction

### Architecture Overview

The YouKOL Clone application uses a server-side authentication approach with PocketBase for user management. The architecture is designed as follows:

```
Client (Browser) <---> Node.js Server <---> PocketBase
```

In this architecture:

- The client never directly communicates with PocketBase
- The Node.js server acts as a proxy for all PocketBase interactions
- Authentication tokens remain entirely server-side
- User sessions are managed via HTTP-only cookies
- Protected routes are secured via middleware

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Enhanced Security**: Authentication tokens are never exposed to client-side code
2. **Simplified Frontend**: The client doesn't need to handle token storage or refresh logic
3. **Centralized Authentication**: All authentication logic is managed in one place
4. **Better Control**: The server can implement additional security measures like rate limiting
5. **Future Flexibility**: Backend authentication provider can be changed without affecting the client

## Implementation Steps

The implementation is divided into logical steps, each building upon the previous one.

### Step 1: Setup PocketBase and Required Dependencies

Before implementing authentication, you need to set up PocketBase and install the required dependencies:

1. Install PocketBase SDK and additional packages:
   ```bash
   npm install pocketbase express-session express-rate-limit helmet cookie-parser
   ```

2. Update environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   # PocketBase Configuration
   POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
   POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@youkol.com
   POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure_admin_password
   
   # Session Configuration
   SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-change-this
   SESSION_MAX_AGE=86400000  # 24 hours in milliseconds
   ```

3. Create a PocketBase service module at `server/services/pocketbase.js`:
   - Connection management
   - Health check functionality
   - Basic admin authentication

### Step 2: Create PocketBase Collections

PocketBase needs properly configured collections for user authentication:

1. Configure the built-in Users collection:
   - Add custom fields like avatar

2. Create a User Profiles collection:
   - Link to Users via relation
   - Store additional user information
   - Track onboarding status

3. Configure appropriate collection permissions:
   - Public access for registration and login
   - Authenticated access for user-specific operations

### Step 3: Implement PocketBase Service

Build a comprehensive service module for interacting with PocketBase:

1. Authentication methods:
   - User registration
   - Login
   - Password reset

2. User profile methods:
   - Profile creation with proper JSON field handling
   - Profile retrieval with fallback creation
   - Profile updates
   - Onboarding status management

3. Utility methods:
   - Enhanced health check with auto-cancellation handling
   - Complete user data retrieval
   - Automatic profile creation for users without profiles

4. JSON field handling:
   - Proper stringification of JSON objects
   - Avoiding sending null values for JSON fields
   - Improved error reporting with data details

5. Error handling:
   - Detailed error logging
   - Fallback mechanisms for common errors
   - Proper status code checking for specific error responses

### Step 4: Add Session Management ✅ Completed

Implement secure session management using Express Session:

```javascript
// server/middleware/session.js
function configureSession() {
  const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
  const isTest = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test';
  
  // Default session configuration
  const sessionConfig = {
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'default-dev-secret-change-this',
    name: 'youkol_session',                             // Custom cookie name
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true,                                   // Prevents client-side JS from reading the cookie
      maxAge: parseInt(process.env.SESSION_MAX_AGE) || 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours by default
      sameSite: 'lax'                                   // Provides CSRF protection
    }
  };
  
  // Apply environment-specific settings
  if (isProduction) {
    sessionConfig.cookie.secure = true;                 // Requires HTTPS
    sessionConfig.cookie.sameSite = 'strict';           // Stronger CSRF protection
  } else if (isTest) {
    // Testing-specific settings for running automated tests
    sessionConfig.cookie.sameSite = 'none';             
    sessionConfig.cookie.secure = false;                
  }
  
  return session(sessionConfig);
}
```

## Field Naming Conventions

To maintain compatibility across the application, the following field naming conventions are used:

### Profile Fields

| Frontend Property | Backend/Database Field | Description |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `displayName`     | `display_name`         | User's display name |
| `bio`             | `bio`                  | User's biography or description |
| `preferences`     | `preferences`          | User's preferences (stored as JSON) |
| `isOnboarded`     | `onboarding_completed` | Whether user has completed onboarding |

The application handles both naming conventions for maximum compatibility. When sending data to the server, you can use either format (camelCase for frontend, snake_case for backend). The server will properly translate between them.

When receiving data from the server, both formats are included in the response for convenience (except in specialized endpoints).

### User Object Structure

The user object attached to the request by the `attachUserData` middleware contains:

```javascript
req.user = {
  id: "user-uuid",                         // PocketBase user ID
  email: "user@example.com",               // User's email
  username: "username",                    // User's username
  displayName: "Display Name",             // User's display name
  isOnboarded: true,                       // Whether onboarding is completed
  profile_id: "profile-uuid"               // PocketBase profile ID
};
```

The `profile_id` is used to update the user's profile data without needing to fetch the profile first.

## Upcoming Features

### Enhancement Preferences Feature (Planned) ⏳

#### Key Components

1. **User Profile Integration**: Enhancement preferences will be stored in the user_profiles collection, within the existing preferences JSON field
   
2. **Onboarding Flow Integration**: New users will be prompted to set their enhancement preferences during the onboarding process, with the option to skip
   
3. **Profile Management**: Users can update their enhancement preferences from the profile edit screen
   
4. **Preference Collection**: User enhancement preferences will be collected and stored for future functionality

#### Enhancement Options

The feature will support the following enhancement options:

- Whiter Teeth
- Paler Skin
